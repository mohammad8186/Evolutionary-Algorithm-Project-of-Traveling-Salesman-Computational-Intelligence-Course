## üìñ Project Overview
This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to solve the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** efficiently. The algorithm optimizes the shortest possible route for visiting multiple cities, considering different selection, crossover, and mutation techniques.

### ‚ú® Key Features:
- **Random population generation** for diverse solutions.
- **Selection methods** like tournament and roulette wheel.
- **Crossover operations** to generate new individuals.
- **Mutation strategies** to enhance diversity.
- **Fitness evaluation** to guide evolution.
- **Convergence criteria** for terminating the algorithm.
- **Data visualization** for route optimization results.

## üöÄ How the Algorithm Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Dataset Preparation:**
- Reads city coordinates from `tsp.txt`.
- Constructs a graph representation of cities.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Population Initialization:**
- Randomly generates a set of possible solutions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Fitness Evaluation:**
- Computes total travel distance for each individual.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Selection:**
- Chooses parents based on fitness using selection techniques.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Crossover & Mutation:**
- Applies genetic operations to generate offspring.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Termination Check:**
- Stops when a defined fitness threshold is met or iterations are exhausted.
